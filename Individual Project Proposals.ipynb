    "  2)Analysis: Descriptive statistics will summarize the central tendency and distribution (mean, median, range) of social interactions, with a focus on different types (e.g., interactions with family, friends, coworkers). Visualization methods such as histograms or density plots will be used to represent the distribution and identify patterns within the frequency data.\n",

    "2.Possible Results and Relevance:\n",
    "  1)Results: Visualizations may reveal common interaction frequencies, highlighting, for instance, whether people most often engage socially on weekends or maintain consistent interaction across the week.\n",
    "  2)Relevance: By identifying interaction trends, we can pinpoint typical social behaviors in the Canadian context, providing baseline information that supports further analysis. This insight addresses project objectives by offering a preliminary view of how social interaction frequency might correlate with overall well-being.\n",

    "3.Methods:\n",
    "  1)Data Summarization: Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range for frequency data.\n",

    "  2)Analysis: Hypothesis testing will examine whether high levels of social interaction are associated with better mental health outcomes. Using t-tests or ANOVA, we’ll compare mental health scores across different interaction frequency groups (e.g., high vs. low interaction). Confidence intervals will quantify the range within which we can expect the true mean mental health scores of each group.\n",

    "2.Possible Results and Relevance:\n",
    "  1)Results: If the results show that higher social interaction frequency corresponds to significantly better mental health (e.g., lower stress levels, higher happiness), this could underscore the importance of social interactions in enhancing well-being.\n",
    "  2)Relevance: Supporting the project’s objective, this analysis could highlight key patterns, reinforcing that fostering social ties can be beneficial to mental health. These insights could also guide targeted campaigns for specific social demographics, promoting frequent engagement with supportive networks.\n",

    "2.Possible Results and Relevance:\n",
    "  1)Results: We might find a positive slope in the regression line, indicating that higher interaction frequency predicts better mental health outcomes. Conversely, a negligible or negative slope could imply that frequency alone may not be sufficient to explain well-being, suggesting the need to examine other factors.\n",
    "  2)Relevance: This analysis provides quantitative backing for the hypothesis that social engagement fosters well-being. Regression analysis outcomes could also inform guidelines for optimal social engagement, potentially impacting public health recommendations shared through the project’s communications.\n",
